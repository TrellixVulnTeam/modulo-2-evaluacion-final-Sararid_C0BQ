<h1 >Hi 👋, I'm Sara</h1>

Please find here my first dynamic website built with Javascript, scss and HTML.

This website allows you to search for any tv shows by typing the name of the show and clicking the search button. The results that you will see are similar to the input name you typed. You can also select and save your favorite tv show in your favorite list (and also unsave it in case you do not consider it your favorite show anymore).

## Quick info about this project

I also used this starter kit as a template with pre-installed y pre-configures functions facilitated by Adalab, my programming school.

This Kit includes an HTML template engine, SASS, a local server, etc. This kit helped me automatize my tasks and allowed me to work more efficiently.

If you are curious to see my code, feel free to checkout the `src/` folder!

(After cloning the repo, you can check the project, by first doing the following:

```bash
npm install
```

and

```bash
npm start
```

)
